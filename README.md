# UltraLims

### This repository contains the answers from the application to UltraLims.

Hi, my name is Gustavo Henrique Dias and this is  my application to UltraLims. This repository contains all the answers from the test I made. It can be separated in two parts, first of all the logical exercises and then, the last one, an exercise with skill requests.

## First Part

The exercises of the first part are named like this:

```bash
ava01ex' '.extension
```
Can be found right on the root of this repository.

## Second Part

There's a separate folder only for this one.

```bash
API-CEP
```
**BUT** it can also be found in other repository:

```bash
[apiviacep](https://github.com/gustapine/apiviacep)
```
The final product can be found here: [VIA CEP](https://apiviacep.vercel.app).
